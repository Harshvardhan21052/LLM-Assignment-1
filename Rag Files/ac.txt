The problem is of course that we are more used to heating systems than to cooling systems (heating is much easier, and humans have been doing it for tens of thousands of years).

And with every heating system, turning up the system means increasing the resulting temperature.

Many A/C systems have a temperature indication, and many even have buttons to increase or decrease the temperature. So effectively, when you mean "please decrease the effectiveness of the A/C", you are asking someone to press the up-arrow key on the A/C, increasing the temperature.

This is an contradictory thing for many people. When I turn up the heating, I increase the temperature. Now you want me to turn up the A/C, then I will likewise increase the temperature.

Strictly speaking, your interpretation makes sense (and as a stickler for literal interpretation, I have used it myself!). For most people, however, "turning up" any appliance that controls temperature means adjusting it in such a way that the temperature will increase.

There are examples where people mean the opposite of what they really say. Maybe the most common example is the confusing fact that electrical current runs in the opposite direction of the movement of the electrons.
