"The Rains of Castamere" is a song appearing in the A Song of Ice and Fire novels and in the television series adaptation Game of Thrones. The lyrics were written by George R. R. Martin in the novel A Storm of Swords, published in 2000, and the song was composed by Ramin Djawadi in 2011, upon request from the television series creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. The song appears multiple times throughout the books and show.
The song recounts the ruthlessness of the character Tywin Lannister in destroying House Reyne ("the Reynes of Castamere") and House Tarbeck, rebellious vassals of House Lannister, some 40 years before the events of the novels. The stanza of the song that appears in the novels and is adapted for the television series tells of the vassals' defiance – "And who are you, the proud lord said / That I must bow so low?" – and the subsequent extermination of their houses: "But now the rains weep o'er his hall / With no one there to hear."
