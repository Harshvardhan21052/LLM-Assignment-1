You are now facing the Northeast direction.
You are facing north in start.
Then you turn 90 degrees left and face west.
Then 180 degrees left so you face east.
Then you reverse direction so you face west now.
Then you turn 45 degrees left now so you face south west.
Then you reverse direction and face north east.

I guess the answer is south â€” west but I am not fully sure. Here is my explanation:
When I turn 90 degrees, I will be facing west but turning 180 degrees, I guess I will be facing east.
After reversing, my direction will be west. If I take left, I'll be facing south. As it's 45 degrees, then my direction will be west to south.
Again reverse, then I will be south west.
